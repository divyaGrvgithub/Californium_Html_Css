Preview the app here: (How your app should finally look like) https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sabihak89/functionUp/blob/main/tiltingnav/index.html

Exercise: (What is the assignment about?)

Based on the app you just previewed(above link), you need to write an HTML page. The CSS and JS components have already been written for you. The assignment is an exercise for the HTML concepts covered in the morning session. CSS and JS will be covered later, hence focus only on the HTML for now.
How to start :
Create a folder with any name, for example tilting-nav would be a good choice.
Place all the three files provided to you in this folder. CSS and JS files must be used as is. Make sure the extensions of all the files are correct.
You will notice the HTML file has a lot of tags missing. The assignment is to complete this index.html file. Follow below instructions to add relevant code to the HTML file. Make sure you follow the instructions otherwise the CSS and JS might not work as expected.
If at any point you feel you need help, refer to the resources mentioned below then the hints file if required for pointers.
The final solution will shared in the same drive folder when the time limit for the assignment runs out.
If after going through the solution you still have queries, please collect your queries for the doubt session planned at the end of all the assignments.
